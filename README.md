## Configuration

### API Key

To use the OpenAI features, you need to set your OpenAI API key in the extension settings:

1. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) in Visual Studio Code.
2. Search for and select **Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)**.
3. Add the following lines to your settings:

```json
"gptCodeAssistant.openaiApiKey": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY", // Replace YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY with your actual OpenAI API key.
"gptCodeAssistant.maxTokens": 300, // Adjust the maximum number of tokens
"gptCodeAssistant.model": "gpt-4" // Choose the GPT model (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k, gpt-4, gpt-4-32k)
```
These settings allow you to customize the GPT model used and the maximum number of tokens for each response.

## Usage

1. Select the code snippet you want to work with.
2. Use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) or the assigned shortcut keys to run any ChatGPT: AI Programming Assistant command.

# Usage Instructions

1. **Select the Code Snippet You Want to Work With**
   - **Example**: Highlight a function in your code that you want to optimize. For instance, if you have the following JavaScript function:
     ```javascript
     function add(a, b) {
         return a + b;
     }
     ```

2. **Use the Command Palette or Assigned Shortcut Keys**
   - **Example 1**: Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`, then type `ChatGPT: AI Programming Assistant` to see the available commands. Choose `Optimize Code` to enhance the selected function.
   - **Example 2**: Alternatively, use the assigned shortcut key for the command. For instance, if you want to generate a unit test for the selected code, simply press `Ctrl+Alt+U` after highlighting your function.

### Additional Examples

- **Select Code for Debugging**:
   - Highlight a piece of code you suspect contains an error. For example:
     ```python
     def divide(x, y):
         return x / y
     ```
   - Press `Ctrl+Alt+D` to use the AI to debug the highlighted code.

- **Generate Code from Comments**:
   - If you have a comment describing what you want to implement, such as `// Create a function to calculate the factorial`, select that comment.
   - Then use `Ctrl+Alt+C` to generate the corresponding code.
